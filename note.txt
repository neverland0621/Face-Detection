1. The visualizations are stored in the visualizations folder where there are folders consisting of all the experiments I have tried out.
2. There are results in each of these folders that depict what are the results obtined for that experiment. However most of these results have
been included in the report as well.
3. There are seperate files for each of the experimnets  eg. run_detector(base implementation),run_detector_extrafeatures(for the 
additional descriptor features), run_detector_hog(for the HoG implementation), run_detector_tree(for the classifier). This follows for the 
other files as well.
