Initial classifier performance on train data:
  accuracy:   0.999
  true  positive rate: 0.398
  false positive rate: 0.001
  true  negative rate: 0.600
  false negative rate: 0.000

the number of samples computed were: 
all features: 16851 X 18268
w: 18268 X 1
b: -1

The accuracy did not seem to change drastically with the addition of the different features.

Takes too long to execute on the test set, since too many features (sift, phow) and hog being computed for each image patch.
